                    <h1>Personal Profile</h1>

                    <p>This should be written just below your contact information and is a great way to pique the
                        interest of the recruiter. It should be a short (3-5 sentences) summary of why you want the job
                        and provide an overview of your skills and experience and how they make you a good fit.
                        Basically, your personal profile is your sales pitch. Get it right and the recruiter will keep
                        reading.</p>

                    <p>Avoid vague descriptions and ‘buzz’ words such as ‘dynamic’ and ‘self-starter’. Instead, open
                        with a specific statement outlining your experience and specialisations.</p>

                        <h1 class="display-4">Key Skills</h1>

                        <hr class="my-4">
                        <p>This is arguably the most important section on your CV. Simply put; recruiters are keen to
                            know what you offer the company. As a result, it is necessary to showcase your skills and
                            outline how you will have a positive influence on the organisation going forward.</p>
                        <p>In the world of recruitment, three types of skills stand out:</p>
                        <p>Adaptive: Skills proven by personality traits rather than experience which makes them
                            difficult to quantify.</p>
                        <p>Transferable: Skills you learn in one field that are relevant to another industry.</p>
                        <p>Job-Related: Skills which are useful in a specific field.</p>
                        <p>When writing your CV, try to focus on job-related and transferable skills such as:</p>

                        <p>Teamwork</p>
                        <p>Communication</p>
                        <p>Problem Solving</p>
                        <p>Flexibility</p>
                        <p>Technical Skills</p>
                        <p>Initiative</p>
                        <p>Interpersonal</p>

                        <p>If you have knowledge of a programming language or computer systems relevant to the job, make
                            sure you include it.</p>
                    </div>


                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-messages" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-messages-tab">
                    <p>As space is at a premium when writing a CV, always think carefully about the educational details
                        you wish to include. For example, do you need to mention the 6 honours you earned in your
                        Leaving Cert when you also have a Bachelor’s Degree in Accounting? As is the case with
                        employment history, ensure your most recent qualifications are first on the page.</p>
                    <p>This is also the section where you can include information on whether you speak another foreign
                        language (if relevant) or if you have professional qualifications such as a chartership. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-settings" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-settings-tab">

                    Hobbies & Interests
                    <p>Some employers like to see evidence that candidates have a social life outside of work but in
                        many cases, there is no real reason to go into much detail here. As is the case throughout your
                        CV, only include information pertinent to the application. While trainspotting and birdwatching
                        probably won’t help you get the job, voluntary experience and charity work may be useful
                        additions.

                    aria-labelledby="v-pills-reference-tab">

                    <p>References</p>
                    <p>Add a line saying ‘references available upon request’. There is no need to include them in your
                        CV. If the company specifically asks for references, include them on a separate sheet.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-contact" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-contact-tab">

                    <p>Contact Information</p>
                    <p>Name Address:Self-explanatory.</p>
                    <p>Phone Numbers: Include your mobile number and consider adding a personal voicemail in case you
                        miss a recruiter’s call. You can include a home phone number but only if you live with people
                        that can be trusted to answer in a polite manner and take messages; this means no hung-over
                        flatmates!</p>
                    <p>Email Address: Use a professional sounding one; the best option is your name or a variation of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Social Media: You can include details of social media accounts but ONLY if they are professional
                        in terms of content. It should be noted that an increasing number of companies DO look at social
                        media accounts of prospective employees deemed to be in with a chance of at least getting an
                        interview. If you have any compromising photos or information you would rather a recruiter
                        didn’t know about, get rid of them before embarking on a job search. While it’s true that once
                        something appears online, it is never truly gone, most companies won’t go to the trouble it
                        takes to dig up dirt; at least not prior to the interview stage!</p>

                    <p>Information you should NOT include:</p>
                    <p>Marital Status: Irrelevant.</p>
                    <p>Nationality: Not important unless you are applying from outside the EU.</p>
                    <p>Date of Birth: You don’t need to include this. Companies can’t legally discriminate due to your
                        age.</p>
                    <p>Photo: Although common in some countries, it is not common practice here in Ireland.</p>

                        <h1 class="display-4">Quick Tips On How To Write A CV</h1>
                        <hr class="my-4">

                        <h1>Structure Your Search </h1>
                        <p>Use Excel to create a spreadsheet and begin your job search by targeting the industries you
                            wish to work in. The next step is to focus on individual industries and look for employers.
                            Then you can use job sites such as www.jobs.ie to create a list of companies you’re
                            interested in working for and find out the people you need to contact.</p>
                        <p>Now you can tailor your CV and cover letter and send it in to the selected individuals. While
                            this is a time consuming process, it will yield far greater rewards than a spray and pray
                            approach.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Add the Cover Letter in the Email’s Body</h1>
                        <p>As most CVs are sent via email these days and the body of the email provides recruiters with
                            their first impression of you; why not take the bull by the horns and give them your cover
                            letter as well? This should unquestionably help you find favour with the hiring manager;
                            especially when they are used to receiving bland emails with CVs attached.</p>
                        <h1>Look For Work Experience</h1>
                        <p>This is particularly relevant if you are a graduate with little in the way of real-world
                            experience. As there are so many candidates for every position, employers are getting
                            fussier which means your Master’s Degree may not be enough if there is no work experience to
                            back it up.</p>
                        <p>Check out the website of the nearest volunteer centre to you and see if there is anything
                            available in your field. Any type of experience in a relevant field you can add to your CV
                            is gold dust in this ultra competitive job market.</p>

                        <h1 class="display-4">Final Thoughts On How To Write A CV</h1>

                        <p>In the main, the layout mentioned above is the best way to present your CV. However, you may
                            wish to place your educational qualifications ahead of your work experience if the latter is
                            not as strong as the former.</p>
                        <p>As your CV (and accompanying cover letter) is the only way in which a prospective employer
                            can determine your suitability for a role, it needs to be as compelling and convincing as a
                            sales pitch. Keep it concise, informative, relevant and above all, positive. Additionally,
                            make sure it is properly formatted with no spelling/grammatical errors with lots of white
                            space and headlines. If you write a high quality CV, you have an excellent chance of beating
                            the odds and getting invited to an interview.</p>
